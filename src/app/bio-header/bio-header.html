      I have a deep interest in frontend software development and UI design, with a strong focus on
      mobile apps and cross-platform frameworks. As part of my PhD, I developed a new e-learning
      solution, called BEACON Q, focused on repeatable quizzes. With the integration of spaced
      repetition, review recommendations and recall analysis, the app offers itself up as a smart
      learning companion to help students keep up with their classes and improve their long-term
      retention.<br /><br />
      Other major works include the development of a new block-based framework, called DartBlock,
      targeting a mobile-first UI design, alongside support for automatic program evaluation and
      dynamic difficulty adjustment.<br /><br />
      I have a long experience of working with the cross-platform framework Flutter, as well as
      native iOS app development using Swift and UIKit. Other than frontend, I have also worked with
      Node.js and MongoDB for the development of a backend REST API server, as well as Python for
      data analysis and visualization.
