        I have a deep interest in frontend software development and UI design, with a strong focus
        on mobile apps and cross-platform frameworks. As part of my PhD, I developed a new
        e-learning solution, called BEACON Q, focused on repeatable quizzes. With the integration of
        spaced repetition, review recommendations and recall analysis, the app offers itself up as a
        smart learning companion to help learners keep up with their classes and improve their
        long-term retention.<br /><br />
        Other major works include the development of a new block-based framework, called DartBlock,
        targeting a mobile-first UI design, alongside support for automatic program evaluation and
        dynamic difficulty adjustment.<br /><br />
        I have a long experience of working with the cross-platform framework Flutter, as well as
        native iOS app development using Swift and UIKit. Other than frontend, I have also worked
        with Node.js and MongoDB for the development of a backend REST API server, as well as Python
        for data analysis and visualization.
